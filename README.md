# CSS Library

A bunch of CSS styles that I use in my projects.

## Demo

See the styles in action [here](https://bomberstudios.github.io/css-library/index.html).

## Usage

In case it wasn't sufficiently clear, please do not use this in any of your projects unless you are me ðŸ˜….

If you are me:

```bash
npm install @bomberstudios/css-library
```

And then include the styles. For example, in an Astro project you can add this to your base Layout:

```jsx
import '@bomberstudios/css-library/index.css'
```
